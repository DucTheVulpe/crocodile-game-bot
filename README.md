# Crocodile Game Bot
This is a Crocodile Game bot for Telegram.
I'm not sure that such game is called "Crocodile" in English,
but in Russian it's called that way. `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`

The main bot instance is here: https://t.me/Crocodile_Game_Bot

## Installation
```
go get -u github.com/nuetoban/crocodile-game-bot
```

## Testing
Execute this command:
```
make test
```

## Database Migrations
We use https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate to perform migrations.
Them are stored in ./migrations/ folder.

To apply migrations to your database do the following:

1. Install `migrate` tool
```
go get -u https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate
```
2. Apply migrations
```
migrate -source file://migrations -database 'postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable' up
```

If you need to downgrade the database schema, run this command
```
migrate -source file://migrations -database 'postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable' down
```
Just `down` instead of `up` in the end of the command.
